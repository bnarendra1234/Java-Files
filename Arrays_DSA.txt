Use Cases of Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures used in a wide range of programming problems. 
They provide a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of elements. 
Here are some common use cases and examples of how arrays are used in coding questions:

Frequency Count:
 

Counting the frequency of each element in an array is another common problem. By using additional data structures like hash maps or arrays of counters, 
you can track the occurrences of each element.

 

Two Sum Problem:
 

The Two Sum problem involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target value. 
By using a hash map or sorting the array and employing two pointers, you can efficiently solve this problem.

 

Sliding Window Technique:
 

The sliding window technique utilizes arrays to solve problems where you must maintain a subset or fixed-size subset while moving through the main array.

 

Dynamic Programming:
 

Arrays are extensively used in dynamic programming to store and retrieve intermediate results for optimising  computations and solving complex problems.

 

Example Problem Statement:
 

Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    int arr[] = {7, 2, 3, 10, 6};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int maxDiff = 0;


    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < size; j++) {
            int diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[j]);
            maxDiff = max(maxDiff, diff);
        }
    }


    cout << "Maximum Difference: " << maxDiff << endl;
    return 0;
}
